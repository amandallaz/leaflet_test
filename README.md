**Project to test plotting lat and lon values in Django using Leaflet.** 

*Notes*  
* I'm using a basic OpenStreetMap here, there are many templates available with different styles.
* Leaflet requires the gdal package. 
  * GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH and GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH defined in settings.py.
  * Paths will likely be different when deploying to server, I also needed to remove gdal from requirements and install a separate version

*Sample observations*
* L'Industrie Pizza Lat 40.7382 Lon -74.0055
* Brooklyn Bridge Lat 40.706086 Lon -73.996864
